# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The project is a back-end application designed to help users manage clothing items for different weather conditions. Users can create, update, delete, and like/dislike clothing items. The server provides an API for clothing items and users, with MongoDB as the database. Users can store their clothing items, link them to their profile, and see what to wear based on the weather. //for reviewer. I hope this is sufficient. Apologies for missing it completely before.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
